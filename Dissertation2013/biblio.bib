@article{Cohn1998,
  abstract = {The papers collected in this issue represent an emerging species of transformational theory drawn together under the "Neo-Riemannian" designation. This introductory essay sketches the origins and recent development of neo-Riemannian theory, and positions it with respect to several other genera of music theory, as well as to an evolving post-structuralist critical practice. Along the way, it seeks to situate Hugo Riemann amidst the flurry of activity occuring beneath the banner bearing his name, and to provide comfort to the perplexed observer who, innocently prying apart these covers and peering within, spies the theoretical tradition of A. B. Marx and Oettingen romping merrily with that of Babbitt, Forte, and Morris. Strange fellows indeed!... or perhaps, upon reflection, not so strange....},

    abstract = {{Abstract BeatRoot is an interactive beat tracking and metrical annotation system which has been used for several years in studies of performance timing. This paper describes improvements to the original system and a large-scale evaluation and analysis of the system's performance. The beat tracking algorithm remains largely unchanged: BeatRoot uses a multiple agent architecture which simultaneously considers several different hypotheses concerning the rate and placement of musical beats, resulting in accurate tracking of the beat, quick recovery from errors, and graceful degradation in cases where the beat is only weakly implied by the data. The original time domain onset detection algorithm, which caused problems for beat tracking music without prominent drums, has been replaced with a more robust onset detector based on spectral flux. Other new features include annotation of multiple metrical levels and phrase boundaries, as well as improvements in the user interface. The software has been rewritten entirely in Java, and it runs on all major operating systems. BeatRoot is evaluated on a new test set of 1360 musical excerpts from a wide range of Western musical styles, and the results are compared with other evaluations such as the MIREX 2006 Audio Beat Tracking Evaluation.}},
